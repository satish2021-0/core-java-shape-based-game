# core-java-shape-based-game
This is a console-based java application.

An educational shape-based game built using Core Java to demonstrate OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and HAS-A relationships.

Technologies Used:- Core Java (Class, Object, Constructor, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Upcasting,
Method Overriding, Method Overloading, Interface, HAS-A Relationship)

Project Description:-
• Developed an interactive educational game focused on helping school students (classes 5 to
12) understand the properties like area, perimeter, volume etc of 2D and 3D shapes ensuring
code modularity and scalability by separating each logic.
• Applied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to model shapes such as Circle,
Rectangle, Square, Sphere, Cube, Cylinder, etc., using inheritance and polymorphism.
• Demonstrated upcasting and dynamic method dispatch by storing shape objects in a parent
reference type and invoking overridden methods at runtime.
• Incorporated HAS-A relationships to build reusable and maintainable components (e.g., a
Game class having multiple Shape objects).
• Designed and implemented interfaces to define common shape behaviors such as draw(),
calculateArea(), and calculateVolume() where applicable.

Through the use of these principles, the game seamlessly provides detailed information about each
selected shape, including crucial metrics such as area and volume. This not only promotes a hands-
on learning experience but also reinforces core programming paradigms. This project showcases my
ability to blend educational content with advanced programming techniques, demonstrating a
commitment to both effective learning and software development expertise.

## Run Instructions
This is a console-based Java application.  
Run the main class and follow the console menu to interact with different shapes.
